This file "bootstraps" the EE environment, so you use the EE "super object" in EE2, or the EE global objects in EE1.

Useful for little one off scripts, or cron jobs that need access to the EE environment.

Example:

<?php
$system_path = '/path/to/system/folder';
include '/path/to/bootstrap.php';

$DB = $EE->db;

...
